# Data_Structure-Implementation


in this repo i will implement first the basic data structure with c++ in form of oop style of code (classes) 

# LinkedList(single) : 
  A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.

# stack (using array):
  Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last    Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
